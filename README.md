Implementing black-box node-level membership inference attacks against graph neural networks. Associated paper: [Practical Bayes-Optimal Membership Inference Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24089)

### Instructions

Specify attack settings in config.yaml and run "src/run_audit.py" to audit using membership inference attacks under the specified setting. CSV files of attack performance statistics, ROC data, and plots are stored in results folder.

### Test

Not much tests, but some can be run by "python -m unittest"
